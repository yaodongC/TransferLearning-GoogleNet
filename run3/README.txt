TransferLearningAlexNet.m use pretrained network to 
conduct transfer learning.

TransferLearningGoogLeNet.m use pretrained network to 
conduct transfer learning

TransferLearningGoogLeNetWithRotationAndReflection.m 
use pretrained network to conduct transfer learning with
images both from training data and new images create from 
training data set.

natsortfiles.m and natsort.m is file from Stephen Cobeldick 
is used to sort files in the natural order.
